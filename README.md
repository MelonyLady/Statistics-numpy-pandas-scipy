# Statistics and a soft introduction to Data Science


This project is part collaboration, part helping a friend with their dissertation for university, part learning about numpy, pandas, and scipy.

It uses an external data set that cannot be shared due to its use in a dissertation, this is however the code that has been used. 

My contribution: formatting (work in progress), teaching the friend how to use python, Fisher Tests,  and statistical background.

In the future, I hope to post my friend's dissertation and re-link the work together.
